            <p>On 2023-03-09</p>

            <p>During my 2nd year internship , I had to train myself in the Angular framework in order to be able to carry out the various missions entrusted to me.</p>

            <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

            <p>Angular is an open source framework based on TypeScript (a strict syntactic superset of JavaScript transcompiled to JavaScript).</p>

            <p>This framework facilitates the creation of web applications, especially single-page web applications. These are accessible via a single web page, which makes the user experience smoother and avoids the loading of new pages for each action. The framework is based on the MVC-type architecture, thus making it possible to separate the data, the visual aspect and the actions for a better management of responsibilities. This architecture is well known for its high maintainability and its ability to improve collaborative work.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Many libraries and packages are available with Angular, I had the opportunity to test, during my internship, Angular Material which allowed me to create forms, tables, customizable buttons on my web project.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>How does Angular work?</h3>

            <p>Angular works from components, representing the different functionalities of the application.</p>

            <p>In a component, we find its interface in HTML, its controller in TypeScript as well as its style in CSS in our case:</p>

            <img src="../../assets/img/Veilles/Veille6/angular3-1024x501.png">
            <br>

            <img src="../../assets/img/Veilles/Veille6/angular4.png">
            <br>

            <p>Then, Angular uses services, which are somewhat like components without interfaces.</p>

            <p>In these services, we will come to put functions with http GET or POST requests for access to data in the database.</p>

            <img src="../../assets/img/Veilles/Veille6/angular5.png">
            <br>

            <p>Following this, to navigate between our pages, between our components, we use routing.</p>

            <p>For this, we use the Routes module as below:</p>

            <img src="../../assets/img/Veilles/Veille6/angular6.png">
            <br>

            <p>A route entered in the url therefore refers to the component associated with it.</p>


            <h3>What is the interest of the Angular framework?</h3>

            <p>The main reason for its popularity is that it is easy and simple to use, it also simplifies the development process and structure of JavaScript Code.</p>

            <p>Here are the <strong>7 big reasons</strong> to use Angular:</p>

            <h4>1. Code Consistency and Reuse</h4>

            <p>Angular has a component-based structure which makes the components highly reusable and simplifies the development process. You can create the UI (user interface) with moving components, while ensuring a stable development process for developers.</p>


            <h4>2. Easy to learn, use and test</h4>

            <p>AngularJS can be easily learned by people who know JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Learning AngularJS opens up more opportunities for developers in the field of web development.</p>

            
            <h4>3. Google support and great community support</h4>

            <p>It is recognized as one of the most trusted frameworks by members of the application development team. Google's web toolkits allow developers to develop a single, user-friendly application.</p>


            <h4>4. SPA-Oriented Features</h4>

            <p>AngularJS and SPAs simply go together, AngularJS supports single-page web application development. The main objective of single page web application development is a faster transition of the website.</p>


            <h4>5. Two-way data link</h4>

            <p>By using the two-way data link, the application will simplify its presentation layer. This allows for a more simplistic and less intrusive approach to the DOM display for creating the UI.</p>


            <h4>6. UI Declarations</h4>

            <p>The Angular framework uses the HTML source to describe the user interface of the application because it is an intuitive, declarative and less complicated language.</p>


            <h4>7. Seamless integration and high-end productivity</h4>

            <p>When implemented for web development projects, AngularJS integrates smoothly with other libraries. AngularJS integration is pre-built with various frameworks such as Wijmo, lonic and Telerik's Kendo Ul.</p>

            <p>I would add to all this that, during the build, Angular is compiled, which brings a certain level of security to our application. For example, we are protected from SQL injections.</p>
